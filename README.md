# EDDFS_dataset
## a retinal fundus dataset for eye disease diagnosis and fundus synthesis  
### EDDFS contains 28877 color fundus images for deep learning-based diagnosis. Except for 15000 healthy samples, the dataset consists of 8 eye disorders including diabetic retinopathy, agerelated macular degeneration, glaucoma, pathological myopia, hypertension, retinal vein occlusion, LASIK spot and others. 

Once you decide to involve this dataset, you must agree to this Data Download Consent. By doing so, you accept all the risks of getting your full dataset.  
Please also notice that:  
1. The EDDFS database is available for non-commercial research purposes only.   
2. The fundus images come from the hospital, which reserves the right to terminate the access to the database at any time.  
3. You agree not to further copy, publish or distribute any portion of the EDDFS database.  
4. All papers or publicly available text using the EDDFS database are expected to cite the following paper(s):
